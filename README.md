# Motor-speed-regulator-with-stm32
The aim is to realize a speed-controlled DC motor with the aid of a digital cascade control usind the Nucleo Board "stm32f303re"
Used Hardware:
              -stm32f303rex
              -dc Motor with encoder
              -motor driver
              -battery 9V
the speed should be controlled using pid controller
